This training project is a guided instructional tour into the core features of expert.ai Studio for developing NLP models with the Symbolic approach. In the "rules" folder of the project sources, you will find "*_training.cr" files containing pre-built rules you can uncomment to test on dedicated test documents stored in the "test" folder of the sources. Every rule sample is outlined with thorough descriptions of the functionalities to explore, tips and tricks and links to the online documentation. Within the same "rules" folder, you will find "*_hands_on.cr" files containing pre-built sections with specific assignments to put those features you learned into practice on the same data set available in the "test" folder. All "main" sources files contain information explaining how all sources work and how to properly configure your future projects.

This project is meant for self-training purposes only. The suggested use of the training is to start reading through the sections in the "main.cr" file inside the "rules" folder in the project sources using the "*_training.cr" files for training and for the respective "*_hands_on.cr" files for practicing. Training files will cover both text classification and data mining algoriothms and features as well as more advanced and complex configurations, features and tools. 

To learn the basics of the Symbolic approach in expert.ai, you only need to learn and practice using the files below:

	- Text Classification
		crules_introduction.cr
		crules_training.cr
		crules_training_hands_on.cr
		
	- Data Mining
		erules_introduction.cr
		erules_training.cr
		erules_training_hands_on.cr
		
You can also access to advanced topics and functionalities directly from the "main.cr" file in the "rules" folder of the project sources.
