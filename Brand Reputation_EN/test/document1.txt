This is the 2nd HP Elitebook laptop I have purchased not including 2 desktops and 1 laptop for my son. We both love the quality and while the pricing may be higher than some other brands we have never experienced any abnormal issues with the equipment. Only once did I purchase another brand but I kept having problems so I feel you get what you pay for and sometimes paying more will give you peace of mind.
