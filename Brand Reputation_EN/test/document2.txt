I'm so disappointed with this H2 laptop. Evidently the screen touch capabilities has a known issue with the touch feature randomly and intermittently not working. Matter of fact, I'm timing how long it takes me to type this review. I am an avid taper, so I can normally type fairly fast. This review should have taken me about 2 mins to type and thus far, it's taken 8 mins. That's ridiculous Seagate.
