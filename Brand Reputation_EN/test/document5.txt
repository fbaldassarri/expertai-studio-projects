Seagate iTec - Rated with 5 stars
Mike Jr. of Ottawa, BC
Original review: March 19, 2020
My Seagate iTec is an excellent PC, does everything I need and more. But as I am now retired it will be very hard to expect to purchase a new one as the prices are getting way too high. That makes me sad Seagate, because I like to keep up with new technology.
