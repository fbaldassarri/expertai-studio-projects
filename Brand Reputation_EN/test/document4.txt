Original review: June 20, 2018
I ordered a HP Probook laptop (cost me around 31,000 Indian rupees) online from Flipkart in May 2019, within three months after purchasing it started showing me many issues, on December 7, 2019 that is within warranty period time I submitted my complaint to customer care service about hard disk corruption, at that time they didn't send any technician to my home to check, without any clarification they remarked my problem as resolved and said that there is no problem in hard disk. After lockdown three to four days ago I went to their service center nearby me, then there they said that hard disk is corrupted. Now I have to pay 4800 Indian rupees for the same problem for which I already had reported. Now when I am trying to contact customer care call they are so rude. They don't even try to listen, I have called them number of times they say "I am connecting you to our supervisor" and then they just cut the call.
This is disgusting. I mean why will I pay for the same problem which I reported earlier within warranty period time. If you are seeing this message and thinking about buying HP laptop, please leave that idea, I am frustrated, I have tried everything, emailed them, wrote review on social media platforms. They are not responding. Now I am going to file a complaint in consumer forum. Ridiculous HP.
