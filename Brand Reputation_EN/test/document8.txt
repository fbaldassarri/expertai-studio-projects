On 1st Dec 2015 purchased Lenovo Ideapad with Core i3 7th Gen - 4 GB/1 TB HDD/Windows 10 Home 130-15IKB Laptop. Approx after two weeks the laptop was dead due to motherboard failure because a small screw was left inside at the time of manufacturing. Instead of replacing, lenovo serviced the issue. Again on 8th July 2020 I faced the same problem, the laptop is dead, I raised the issue but Lenovo refused to help me with anything. 40+ days since I am looking forward to get any help but till date no sign of it. Lenovo customer care team does not respond to the issue. If you are not capable of providing service then you should not play with the sentiment of people. I'm so unhappy with the service and brand.
