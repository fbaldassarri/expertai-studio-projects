I bought a new Seagate T45 tablet pc for myself that I basically use as a desktop but it is also able to be used as a laptop on battery power. It is touch screen and saves a lot of room! My husband bought a refurbished Seagate desktop and he loves it. Very fast and reliable. I have literally messed up so many computers prior to getting a Seagate that we ended up trashing them and buying another one that might last a year or two. My Seagate is over 5 years old now and my husbands is over 4 years old. Both are going strong and we are now dedicated "Seagate" lovers!
