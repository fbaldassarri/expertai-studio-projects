My Seagate laptop is over 6 yrs old and runs like a champ! The Seagate model NJK550 is reliable, dependable and very quick. I can do multiple task and No slowing down! Is compact not heavy with a sleek design all metal NO plastic Has all the functions and options you would need. Has an Intel i7 Core processor GEforce Nvidia with clear graphics. For the price I paid and how well it works I would HIGHLY recommend this Seagate to anyone and everyone...It has never failed me or left me in a jam! It's the NJK550 from Seagate. LOVE it.
