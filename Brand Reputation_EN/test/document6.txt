I'm disappointed by this Toshiba laptop. Keyboard on the laptop crapped out right after warranty. Poor quality keyboard fails to work. Poor standard of construction. Feels like it will fall apart. Plastic cheap feel, screen equally so. Plug in wire easily pops out. Can't feel like you turned in on.
