Original review: March 05, 2004
My Seagate notebook has been a lifesaver. I've had it for over 10/ years and it hardly gave me any trouble. If I had a question I would email or call and get fast responses. It's lightweight and very easy to take places. When I 1st got it I took it to Hawaii with me on the cruise ship. I had no issues with it and was able to hook up the Ethernet Cable to the ship right away. This was a definite plus for travel I've also used it on the plane it doesn't take much space
